# OWL-StatsBot

[OWL-StatsBot user profile](https://reddit.com/user/OWL-StatsBot)

This is a basic reddit bot that provides users with player statistics from the Overwatch League. Operates in [r/competitiveoverwatch](https://reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch).

`!stats [Player Name]` will provide stats for that player (e.g. `!stats Gesture`).  
`!stats [Player1 Name] [Player2 Name]` will compare the statistics for the two players.

All statistics sourced from [here](https://api.overwatchleague.com/stats/players?stage_id=regular_season).
